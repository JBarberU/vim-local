# vim-local

This plugin makes it possible to use a local vimrc. The plugin checks for the 
file .vimrc.local, and if it exists sources it.

That means you can do all sorts of fun stuff on a per-project-basis, such as: 
color schemes, indentation levels, fonts etc.

I found the idea here: http://www.vimninjas.com/2012/08/30/local-vimrc/ (written 
by Veselin Todorov)

I wanted it in a bundle, so I made one :)
